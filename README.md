# Array-Sort
This code takes users array and sorts it in descending order.

This Java program sorts an array of integers provided as command-line arguments using a selection sort-like algorithm.
It prints the array before and after sorting. The smallest number is repeatedly identified and added to a new sorted array, 
while replacing it with a large placeholder value in the original array to prevent reuse.
